# FindbyPlate2
a lisense plate lookup tool i made. part of osint
I made this so I could know more about a vehicle and get more info about it
I also made this so it would be easier to use unlike most programs this one uses findbyplate.com 
like a free API kinda.

#Updates!
1. format of findbyplate2 has been updated
2. speed of receiving information is faster
3. loading animation has been changed

# description
It will give u a shell like interface, type help to see commands 
i am still working on this program to extract the information from the givin output


you will probably have to go to the website first and lookup the lisense plate then go back to your terminal and input the lisense plate and state for example - CA and lisense plate
