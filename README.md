# FindbyPlate2
a lisense plate lookup tool i made. part of osint
I made this so I could know more about a vehicle and get more info about it
I also made this so it would be easier to use unlike most programs this one uses findbyplate.com 
like a free API kinda. This tool does not work with a proxy so proxy settings will need to be off.

# Updates!
1. format of findbyplate2 has been updated
2. speed of receiving information is faster
3. loading animation has been changed
4. google search added to vin search

# description

i am still working on this program to extract the information from the givin output

# installation
```
git clone https://github.com/openpolicy0/FindbyPlate2.git
